- ${decoration.decorationElements?.slice(0, 3).join(', ') || 'colorful accents'}
- DECORATION SIZES: Mix of large, medium, and small decorations for visual interest
- PLACEMENT RULES (vary based on character's gaze direction):
  * If character looks LEFT: place more decorations on the RIGHT side
  * If character looks RIGHT: place more decorations on the LEFT side
  * If character looks UP: decorations float ABOVE
  * If character looks DOWN or CENTER: decorations scattered asymmetrically around
- CHARACTER POSITION: Does NOT need to be centered!
  * Can be slightly LEFT, RIGHT, or use rule-of-thirds composition
  * Leave breathing room in the direction character is looking
- Create visual FLOW and BALANCE, not rigid symmetry
- Some decorations can OVERLAP edges of frame for dynamic feel
- Layer decorations: some in front, some behind character
